# WDI Project 4 Gallery

Each student creates a new Issue, using this name template "`<ProjectName> <FirstName><LastInitial>`".  e.g. "Tunr AdamB", "Grumblr RobinT".  The issue should contain a link to their project's repo and the url to their deployed project.

Instructors close all issues after each cohort.
